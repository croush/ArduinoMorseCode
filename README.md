# ArduinoMorseCode
Claire Roush

A simple program to translate english phrases into morse code and send to the built in LED on the Arduino UNO.

This is a simple test to gain familiarity with the UNO controller. It is began loosely with the Arduino BLINK tutorial
that can be found at https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/blink. It was then extended. 

The program takes a string and translates it to morse code then dispays the result in a loop.

To Do:
    *Extend the program to incorporate user input in some way (other than hard-coded).
    
    *Find alternative ways to display morse code (other leds, christmas lights, monitor, sound?)
